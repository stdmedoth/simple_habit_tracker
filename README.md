# Habit Tracker

This is a simple Habit Tracker application built with PHP and SQLite. It allows users to create and track habits, set success and failure goals, and monitor progress on a daily basis. The project uses an SQLite database to store habit data and track progress over time.

## Features

- **Create New Habits:** Users can add new habits with a name, description, success goal, and failure threshold.
- **Track Progress:** Users can update their daily progress by marking successes or failures for each habit.
- **View Habit Progress:** A detailed view of each habitâ€™s progress for the current month.
- **Delete Habits:** Users can delete any habit they no longer wish to track.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/habit-tracker.git
cd habit-tracker
```

### 2. Set up the Database

This project uses SQLite for database management. The database (`habits.db`) is created automatically when the application runs, but you can initialize it manually if needed by running the provided SQL commands.

### 3. Set up the Web Server

Ensure you have a local PHP server running. You can use the built-in PHP server for testing:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then, navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your web browser.

## Usage

### Creating Habits

To create a new habit, fill out the form at the top of the page with the habit's name, description, success goal, and failure threshold. Click the "Add Habit" button to save it.

### Updating Progress

For each habit, you can update your daily progress by marking successes or failures. Use the respective buttons to log progress.

### Viewing Progress

The "Monthly Progress" section shows a summary of successes and failures for each habit throughout the month. Each day will be represented by a cell in a table, with a checkmark for success, a cross for failure, and an empty cell if no progress was made.

### Deleting Habits

To delete a habit, click the "Delete" link next to the habit. A confirmation prompt will appear before the habit is removed.
